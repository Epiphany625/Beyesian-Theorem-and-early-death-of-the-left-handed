# Bayesian Theorem and Early Death of the Left-Handed

## Project Description
Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie are among the well-known left-handed individuals. A startling 1991 study claimed that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. This project aims to delve into this intriguing claim. 

Using age distribution data, this investigation attempts to discern if there is a genuine discrepancy in the average age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals, stemming solely from the varying rates of left-handedness over time. The goal is to challenge and potentially refute the assertion of premature mortality in left-handers.

### Methodology
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Utilizing `pandas` along with other Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Statistical Approach**: Implementing Bayesian statistics to assess the likelihood of being a certain age at death in correlation to being left-handed or right-handed.
- **Data Sources**: The study leverages two distinct datasets, encompassing extensive data processing and analysis.

### Objectives
- **Examine Age Distribution**: Explore the patterns of mortality among left-handed versus right-handed individuals.
- **Statistical Evaluation**: Apply Bayesian methods to evaluate the impact of hand preference on age at death.
- **Data Interpretation**: Draw meaningful conclusions from complex datasets, providing insights into the longevity dynamics associated with handedness.
